# SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles for writing maintainable and scalable software. These principles are widely used in object-oriented programming and are crucial for creating high-quality code that is easy to understand, modify, and extend.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The SRP states that a class should have only one reason to change, i.e., a single responsibility.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

The OCP suggests that classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

The LSP states that objects of a derived class should be able to replace objects of the base class without affecting the correctness of the program.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

The ISP suggests that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The DIP states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
